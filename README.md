# Unexpected Null Handling in foo Function

This repository demonstrates an uncommon JavaScript bug related to unexpected null handling in a function.  The `foo` function does not explicitly handle `null` values as arguments, potentially leading to runtime errors or incorrect results.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function is expected to perform certain operations based on the input arguments `a` and `b`. However, when either `a` or `b` is `null`, the function's behavior is undefined, potentially leading to unexpected results or exceptions. The current implementation simply returns prematurely without any explicit handling of the null case.

## Solution

The issue is resolved by adding explicit checks for null values and handling them appropriately.  The solution provides a more robust and predictable approach to handling null inputs, preventing potential errors and improving the function's overall reliability.
